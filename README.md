# CraftPlugins
These are the Bukkit plugins I am developping:

##Blockode:

This is a small game I write for fun and also for use in my server. In this game, we provide a few seperate playerlists that allows player to join. 
Each list will be maintained as a game. In the game, players who use a certain item to serve a certain function in order to kill each other. Any kinds 
of maps are suitable for this game. 

###Command Usage:
Use `/addtoplayerlist` or `/addtoplayerlist [player]` to add a player to a playerlist. (Till now, I only provide one playerlist)
Use `/removefromplayerlist` or `/aremovefromplayerlist [player]` to remove a player from a playerlist. (Till now, I only provide one playerlist)
(When adding or removing, player status will be initialized including Exp level and speed.)
Use `/getinfo` to gather the current game info.
